# SF FLEX - Postgres SQL and PsycoPG2 practice
**Author**: Cameron Bronstein

This is an intermediate introduction to the SQL querying language using the `postgres` command line API and the `psycopg2` python wrapper/ API.

The goals of this lesson are to gain experience querying a database with two methods: 

**First**, running SQL commands in the postgres CLI to gain experience with the more bare bones structure of `postgres`.

**Second**, running SQL commands and other Python scripting using `psycopg2`.
